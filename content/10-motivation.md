# Motivation

- clarify relevance, need in community
- large-scale Kubernetes-based and controller-based deployments
- core Kubernetes components scale well
  - sig-scalability cares about scalability of core components, but core components only [@k8scommunity]
  - scalability thresholds, e.g., 5k nodes [@k8scommunity]
- but external components like custom controllers are not included in scalability considerations/guarantees

- custom controllers need to scale
  - <https://twitter.com/ibuildthecloud/status/1717369625904848945>
- custom controllers/operators typically facilitate heavier reconciliation processes compared to core controllers [@kubevela]
- some projects with large-scale deployments have already implemented sharding on their own
  - highly specific to individual projects
  - cannot be reused
  - all implementations face similar challenges
  - typically, not fully matured yet
- sharding is asked for/considered in many projects

  - velero: <https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/issues/487>
  - controller-runtime: <https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime/issues/2576>
  - Operator SDK: <https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/issues/1540>
  - Metacontroller: <https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/metacontroller/issues/190>
- there is no common design or implementation, that can be applied to arbitrary controllers
- reusable concept and implementation would benefit the controller ecosystem
