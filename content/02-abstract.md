\chapter*{Abstract}

In Kubernetes, custom controllers play a pivotal role in managing diverse workloads and infrastructure through the operator pattern.
With the proliferation of open-source projects leveraging this pattern for building applications, services, and platforms, large-scale Kubernetes deployments have become common.
While the Kubernetes core components are guaranteed to scale efficiently up to certain thresholds, those guarantees neglect the scalability of external components like custom controllers.

Typically, Kubernetes controllers prevent uncoordinated and conflicting actions of concurrent reconciliations by using a leader election mechanism to determine a single active controller instance.
This limits scalability options for controllers to vertical scaling because reconciliation work cannot be distributed across multiple controller instances.
While some projects have introduced sharding mechanisms to address the need for horizontal scalability, these solutions are often project-specific and lack reusability.

This thesis bridges this gap by proposing an approach to achieve horizontal scalability in Kubernetes controllers based on existing API and controller machinery.
Building upon proven mechanisms from distributed databases, the design distributes the responsibility for API objects across a ring of controller instances, removing the scalability limitations inherent in traditional leader election setups.
Key features include dynamic membership and failure detection for automatic fail-overs and rebalancing, a consistent hashing algorithm for ensuring a balanced distribution of API objects, label-based coordination for transparent object assignments without client interaction, and a dedicated handover protocol for preventing concurrent reconciliations.

A reusable implementation is presented that allows for easy integration of the mechanism into arbitrary controllers, opening potential for adoption and collaboration within the open-source community.
Through systematic evaluation, all identified requirements are demonstrated to be met.
The mechanism showcases minimal overhead compared to singleton controller setups and an almost linear increase of the controller's load capacity with every added controller instance.
This work contributes to advancing the scalability and efficiency of Kubernetes controllers, offering promising prospects for the future development and usage of Kubernetes and controller-based applications and platforms.
