# Evaluation {#sec:evaluation}

This chapter evaluates the presented design (chapter [-@sec:design]) and implementation (chapter [-@sec:implementation]) by conducting systematic load test experiments.
The components are observed by a monitoring setup to perform measurements that are eventually discussed.

## Experiment Setup

The development and testing setup described in [@sec:impl-setup] serves as a basis for the experiment setup used for evaluation.
Most notably, the evaluation uses the sharding system components and monitoring setup based on kube-prometheus [@prometheusoperatordocs].
In addition, it also deploys the webhosting-operator as an example sharded controller.
The webhosting-operator was developed in the context of the previous study project and supports enabling the sharding mechanism based on the internal sharder design ([@sec:related-study-project]) [@studyproject].
To evaluate the new external sharder mechanism presented in this thesis, the webhosting-operator is adapted to comply with the contract for `ClusterRings` similar to [@sec:impl-shard].
With this, the webhosting-operator can be deployed in three different configurations: singleton (sharding disabled), internal sharder (design from study project), external sharder (design from this thesis).
This allows comparing all three setups using load test experiments.
\todo{more details?}

As described in [@sec:controller-scalability], the scale of controller setups can be described in two dimensions: the number of API objects and the churn rate of API objects.
The webhosting-operator's main resource are `Website` objects, which control `Deployment`, `ConfigMap`, `Service`, and `Ingress` objects.
Accordingly, increasing the load on the webhosting-operator involves creating many `Website` objects and triggering `Website` reconciliations.
Additionally, changing the `Theme` referenced by a `Website`, also triggers a `Website` reconciliation.
Hence, the object churn rate of the webhosting-operator can also be increased by mutating the referenced `Themes`.

Load test experiments are conducted using the experiment tool developed as part of the study project [@studyproject].
It runs different experiment scenarios which continuously create and delete `Website` objects and trigger reconciliations for them.
With this, it can be used for increasing the scale of the example operator setup according to the described load dimensions.
During load tests, the webservers configured by `Website` objects are not actually run.
Running thousands of individual webservers would require an immense amount of compute resources although it is not required by the managing controller itself.
Hence, the website's `Deployments` are configured with `spec.replicas=0`.
With this, the usual reconciliation flow of `Websites` is not changed, as the controller still waits for the `Available` condition of `Deployments` to be true, but no compute power is required for actually running the webservers.

The experiments are performed on a cluster managed by a custom Gardener [@gardenerdocs] installation on STACKIT [@stackitdocs].
The evaluation cluster features multiple worker pools as shown in [@tbl:worker-pools] for better isolation of the observed components (`sharding` worker pool), the observing components (`system` worker pool), and the experiment tool generating the load (`experiment` worker pool).
All worker pools run virtual machines of the `g1a.8d` flavor[^flavors], which has 8 vCPUs and 32 GB memory.
A flavor without CPU overcommitment is chosen for more stability and better reproducibility of the experiments, because they cannot be affected by steal time [@stackitdocs].

| worker pool | flavor | hosted components | count |
|-----------------|--------|------------------------------------------|--------|
| system (default) | g1a.8d | cluster system, monitoring   | 2   |
| sharding         | g1a.8d | sharder, webhosting-operator | 2â€“3 |
| experiment       | g1a.8d | experiment tool              | 1   |

: Worker pools of the evaluation cluster {#tbl:worker-pools}

[^flavors]: <https://docs.stackit.cloud/stackit/en/virtual-machine-flavors-75137231.html>

For Kubernetes clusters managed by Gardener ("shoot" clusters), the control plane components are hosted in another cluster ("seed" cluster) [@gardenerdocs].
The seed cluster that hosts the control plane components of the evaluation cluster is modified to run machine flavors without CPU overcommitment (`c1a.8d`).
Additionally, the main control plane components (etcd and kube-apiserver) of the evaluation cluster run on dedicated worker pool using the `s1a.16d` flavor.
The control plane runs a single etcd instance and 4 kube-apiserver instances.
To ensure a stable and reproducible evaluation environment, autoscaling of the main control plane components is disabled.
Instead, etcd and kube-apiserver pods are assigned static resource requests and limits (12 CPUs and 12 GiB memory).
Requests and limits are set to the same values to guarantee the requested resources [@k8sdocs].
As the `Deployment` and `ReplicaSet` controllers needs to perform a high rate of reconciliations when generating load for the webhosting-operator, the client-side rate limits of kube-controller-manager are increased to 800 requests per second with bursts of up to 1000 requests per second.

Similar to the control plane components, the observed components (sharder and webhosting-operator) are configured with static and equal resource requests and limits.
The sharder `Deployment` is configured to run 2 replicas for a high availability of the sharder webhook.
Both replicas are guaranteed 200m CPUs and 128 MiB memory.
The active sharder instance runs 5 concurrent workers for the `clusterring`, `shardlease`, and `sharder` controllers respectively.
Depending on the experiment scenario and controller setup, different numbers of replicas of the webhosting-operator are deployed.
Each instance is guaranteed 2 CPUs and 1 GiB memory.
By default the webhosting-operator runs 15 concurrent workers for the `website` controller.
If the webhosting-operator is deployed as a singleton controller, it runs 50 workers for the `website` controller to allow comparing experiment runs of sharded and non-sharded setups with the same load.
If the internal sharder is enabled, the leader instance runs 5 workers for the `shardlease` controller, and 10 workers for the `sharder` controllers respectively.

To ensure a clean evaluation environment, the experiment tool restarts all observed components and waits for them to be healthy before starting the load tests.
For the measurements to be meaningful, all cluster component and all controllers are monitoring during the experiments to ensure that the system is not limited due to CPU throttling, etcd disk performance, server-side or controller-side concurrency limits, or client-side rate limits.

## Measurements

To determine the controller's performance, several measurements are taken during load test experiments.
For this, the monitoring setup's Prometheus instance [@prometheusdocs] is used to collect and store metrics from the controller instances themselves, but also from kubelet's cadvisor endpoint [@k8sdocs; @cadvisor] and other exporters like kube-state-metrics [@kubestatemetrics].
After performing the load tests, the relevant metrics are retrieved from the Prometheus HTTP API using the measure tool [@studyproject] for later analysis and visualization.
The tool fetches raw time series data and stores the result matrices in CSV-formatted files.

For the measurements to be meaningful, the Kubernetes cluster SLOs themselves as described in [@sec:kubernetes-scalability] must be satisfied.
I.e., it must be ensured that the cluster itself where the controllers are running on is performing well.
While the latency of API requests (SLI 1 and 2) are relevant for the experiment setup, pod startup latency (SLI 3) is irrelevant as the load tests don't trigger pod startups.

In the context of this evaluation, both API request latency SLIs are defined even stricter.
The official SLIs exclude custom resources but they are explicitly included in measurements of this evaluation.
This is done because the webhosting-operator's main resources are extended resources.
Furthermore, the latency for mutating API calls is measured including webhook call latency, as the sharder webhook is an integral element of the evaluated sharding design.
For considering the setup as performing well, the request latency increase caused by the sharder webhook should be reasonably low.
Without taking these aspects into account, the measurements would not be meaningful for the concrete experiment setup.
Including extended resources and webhook call latency in the SLIs will yield worse performance measurements.
Hence, the cluster is considered to perform well if the stricter measurements still satisfy the official SLOs.

The central store for control plane metrics is consulted for verifying that both SLOs are met using the queries shown in [@lst:k8s-slo-queries].
The queries are similar to the queries used in Kubernetes performance tests[^perftests-queries] for the same purpose [@perftests].
The `$__range` placeholder is substituted by the corresponding experiment's duration.
I.e., SLIs are not measured per cluster-day but only over the duration of the load test.

\todo{Update with final configuration}

Next, the load on the evaluated controller setup needs to be recorded during experiments to determine the load capacity of a setup using a given resource configuration and to allow comparing results of different scenarios.
For this, both load dimensions of controllers defined in [@sec:controller-scalability] need to be measured for the tested controller.
Applied to the webhosting-opperator, the number of objects that are watched and reconciled by the controller (dimension 1) is the number of `Website` objects in the cluster.
This can be measured using the `kube_website_info` metric exposed for every `Website` object by the webhosting exporter [@studyproject].
On the other hand, the churn rate of API objects (dimension 2) for the webhosting-operator is the rate at which `Website` objects are created and deleted, and the rate at which `Website` reconciliations are triggered.
In experiments, `Website` reconciliations are triggered by setting the `experiment-reconcile` to the current timestamp.
\todo{change theme ref instead}
The experiment tool is based on controller-runtime and individual actions in scenarios are performed by reconciliations of different controllers.
Hence, this load dimension can be measured using the reconciliation-related metrics exposed by controller-runtime.
[@Lst:load-queries] shows the precise queries for measuring the described load dimensions during experiments.

```yaml
queries:
- name: website-count # dimension 1
  query: |
    count(kube_website_info)
- name: website-churn # dimension 2
  query: |
    sum(rate(
      controller_runtime_reconcile_total{
        job="experiment", result!="error",
        controller=~"website-(generator|deleter|mutator)"
      }[1m]
    )) by (controller)
```

: Queries for measuring controller load {#lst:load-queries}

\todo{Update with final configuration}

To ensure the controller setup is performing well under the generated load, the SLIs for controllers defined in [@sec:controller-scalability] are measured as well.
The time that object keys are enqueued for reconciliation (SLI 1) is directly derived from the queue-related metrics exposed by controller-runtime.
For SLI 2, the time until changes to the desired state of `Websites` are reconciled and ready is measured by the experiment tool.
The tool acts as a client of the `Website` API, i.e., an observer of the system's user experience.
For every `Website` creation and specification change, it measures the time it takes for the controller to observe the new generation and for the `Website` to become ready.
This includes the time until the corresponding watch event is received by the tool, which is important for reflecting the observed user experience.
For secondary reconciliation triggers, e.g., changing the referenced `Theme`, its difficult to measure how long it takes the controller to observe the external change and reconcile `Websites` accordingly.
Thus, `Theme` mutations are not performed during load test experiments for more accurate measurements.

          job="experiment"
        }[$__range]
    )))
```

: Queries for verifying controller SLOs {#lst:controller-slo-queries}

\todo{Update with final configuration}

[@Lst:controller-slo-queries] shows the queries used to verify that the described controller SLOs are satisfied.
Similar to verifying the control plane's SLOs, the measurements are taken over the duration of the load test instead of per cluster-day.
Note that the measurement for SLI 2 is stricter than the definition in [@sec:controller-scalability].
Originally, the reconciliation latency SLI excluded reconciliation time of controlled objects, as they are out of scope of the measured controller's responsibility.
In the load tests however, the reconciliation time of controlled objects â€“Â namely, `Deployments` â€“Â is short, because no replicas are actually deployed.
The `Deployment` controller just needs to observe the object and set the `Available` condition to true.
Hence, the measurement used for verifying SLO 2 includes the reconciliation time `Deployments` of `Websites` for simplicity.
Furthermore, the user's performance expectations are the same regardless of whether the controller is sharded or not.
Therefore, the measurement includes the sharding assignment latency related to the sharder's webhook or the sharder's controller respectively.

\todo[inline]{how are SLOs verified}

As described in [@sec:kubernetes-scalability], measuring the scalability of a system typically involves determining the maximum load capacity of different resource configurations.
Similar to measuring the scalability of a Kubernetes cluster itself, following this approach for a controller setup is difficult and costly.
E.g., this approach requires limiting the amount of compute resources available to a single component.
When limiting the available amount of memory of a controller, the process is terminated by the kernel when allocating more memory than this amount.
With this, performance measurements could not be taken anymore and the experiment would simply fail.
Also, it is not possible to increase a virtual machine's network bandwidth on some cloud infrastructure providers.

For simplicity and better reproducibility of the results, this thesis takes a different approach for evaluating the scalability of controller setups.
The experiments are executed with varying load but without strict resource limitations for the observed components.
Provided that the defined SLOs are satisfied, the resource usage of the evaluated components is measured.
This resource usage allows deducing how much resources must be added to the system for it to sustain the generated amount of load.
In other words, instead of determining the load capacity of different resource configurations, the resources needed for a varying amount of load are measured.
When observing a lower resource usage of one setup in comparison to another setup under the same amount of load, it indicates a higher degree of scalability of the former setup.

[@Lst:resource-usage-queries] shows the queries used for measuring the resource consumption of the sharding components and the webhosting-operator.
Similar to the experiments in the study project [@studyproject], the CPU and network usage are measured based on the kubelet's cadvisor metrics [@k8sdocs; @prometheusdocs].
However, the memory usage is determined based on metrics exposed by the Go runtime.
This gives a better estimation of the actual memory requirements of the controller than the kernel's resident size set (RSS) record of the process, due to how Go facilitates memory management.
E.g., the Go runtime doesn't immediately release heap memory freed by garbage collection back to the operating system.
Hence, the process can hold more memory of the system than actually needed by the program,Â also due to the runtime's batch-based memory allocation.
The query used in this evaluation subtracts all released, unused, and free memory from the total amount of memory allocated by the process.

## Experiments

### Basic Load

- increase load until a pre-defined limit
- measure resource usage, ensure SLOs are met
- run with singleton, internal sharder, external sharder
- show distribution of work/resource usage proportional to number of objects
- show that overhead of sharder doesn't increase with number of objects any more (req. \ref{req:constant})
- show that all Websites are ready

### Scale Out

- show that more replicas bring more performance, allow increasing the load while keeping SLOs (req. \ref{req:scale-out})
- this is what proves that controllers are horizontally scalable now!
- limit instances: CPU, memory, concurrent workers
- run basic scenario against external sharder setup with 1, 2, 3 replicas
- measure the maximum load under which SLOs are still satisfied
- show that more replicas bring higher maximum load
- show that overhead of sharding is constant, independent of number of objects (load) (req. \ref{req:constant})

### Rolling Updates

- rolling updates of controller
- evaluate coordination on object movements
- show that SLOs are still met

### Chaos Testing

- randomly kill instances/leader
- similar to [knative chaosduck](https://github.com/knative/pkg/blob/main/leaderelection/chaosduck/main.go#L17)
- show that SLOs are still met

### Autoscaling

- similar to scale out scenario
- horizontal autoscaling of controller according to load
