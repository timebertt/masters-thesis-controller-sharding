# Evaluation {#sec:evaluation}

This chapter evaluates the presented design (chapter [-@sec:design]) and implementation (chapter [-@sec:implementation]) by conducting systematic load test experiments.
A monitoring setup observes the components to perform measurements that are eventually discussed.

## Experiment Setup

The development and testing setup described in [@sec:impl-setup] serves as a basis for the experiment setup used for evaluation.
Most notably, the evaluation uses the sharding system components and monitoring setup based on kube-prometheus [@prometheusoperatordocs].
In addition, it also deploys the webhosting-operator as an example sharded controller.
The webhosting-operator was developed in the context of the previous study project and supports enabling the sharding mechanism based on the internal sharder design ([@sec:related-study-project]) [@studyproject].
To evaluate the new external sharder mechanism presented in this thesis, the webhosting-operator is adapted to comply with the contract for `ClusterRings` similar to [@sec:impl-shard].
With this, the webhosting-operator can be deployed in three different configurations: singleton (sharding disabled), internal sharder (design from study project), and external sharder (design from this thesis).
This allows for the comparison of all three setups using load test experiments.

As described in [@sec:controller-scalability], the scale of controller setups can be described in two dimensions: the number of API objects and the churn rate of API objects.
The webhosting-operator's main resource are `Website` objects, which control `Deployment`, `ConfigMap`, `Service`, and `Ingress` objects.
Accordingly, increasing the load on the webhosting-operator involves creating many `Website` objects and triggering `Website` reconciliations.
Additionally, changing the `Theme` referenced by a `Website`, also triggers a `Website` reconciliation.
Hence, the object churn rate of the webhosting-operator also depends on the churn rate of the referenced `Themes`.

Load test experiments are conducted using new and refined scenarios for the experiment tool developed as part of the study project [@studyproject].
The experiment scenarios continuously create, update, and delete `Website` objects to trigger reconciliations.
These are used for increasing the scale of the controller setup according to the described load dimensions.
The web servers configured by `Website` objects are not actually run during load tests.
Running thousands of individual web servers would require an immense amount of computing resources, although the managing controller itself does not require it.
Hence, the website's `Deployments` are configured with `spec.replicas=0`.
With this, the usual reconciliation flow of `Websites` is not changed, as the controller still waits for the `Available` condition of `Deployments` to be `True`, but no computing power is required for running the web servers.

The experiments are performed on a cluster managed by a custom Gardener [@gardenerdocs] installation on STACKIT [@stackitdocs].
The evaluation cluster features multiple worker pools as shown in [@tbl:worker-pools] for better isolation of the observed components (`sharding` worker pool), the observing components (`system` worker pool), and the experiment tool generating the load (`experiment` worker pool).
All worker pools run virtual machines of the `g1a.8d` flavor[^flavors], which has 8 vCPUs and 32 GB memory.
A flavor without CPU overcommitment is chosen for more stability and better reproducibility of the experiments because they cannot be affected by steal time [@stackitdocs].

| worker pool | flavor | hosted components | count |
|-----------------|--------|------------------------------------------|--------|
| system (default) | g1a.8d | cluster system, monitoring   | 2   |
| sharding         | g1a.8d | sharder, webhosting-operator | 2â€“3 |
| experiment       | g1a.8d | experiment tool              | 1   |

: Worker pools of the evaluation cluster {#tbl:worker-pools}

[^flavors]: <https://docs.stackit.cloud/stackit/en/virtual-machine-flavors-75137231.html>

For Kubernetes clusters managed by Gardener ("shoot" clusters), the control plane components are hosted in another cluster ("seed" cluster) [@gardenerdocs].
The seed cluster that hosts the control plane components of the evaluation cluster is modified to run machine flavors without CPU overcommitment (`c1a.8d`).
Additionally, the evaluation cluster's main control plane components (etcd, kube-apiserver, kube-controller-manager) run on a dedicated worker pool using the `s1a.16d` flavor.
The control plane runs a single etcd instance, four kube-apiserver instances, and a single kube-controller-manager instance.
Autoscaling of the main control plane components is disabled to ensure a stable and reproducible evaluation environment.
All three components are assigned static resource requests and limits: etcd and kube-apiserver use 12 CPUs and 12 GiB memory, and kube-controller-manager uses 6 CPUs and 6 GiB memory.
Requests and limits are set to the same values to guarantee the requested resources [@k8sdocs].
As the `Deployment` and `ReplicaSet` controllers need to perform a high rate of reconciliations when generating load for the webhosting-operator, the client-side rate limits of kube-controller-manager are increased to 2000 requests per second with bursts of up to 2200 requests per second.
The `Deployment` and `ReplicaSet` controllers run 50 concurrent workers each.

Like the control plane components, the observed components (sharder and webhosting-operator) are configured with static and equal resource requests and limits.
The sharder `Deployment` is configured to run two replicas for a higher availability of the sharder webhook.
Both replicas are guaranteed 200m CPUs and 128 MiB memory.
The active sharder instance runs 5 concurrent workers for the `clusterring`, `shardlease`, and `sharder` controllers each.
Depending on the experiment scenario and controller setup, different numbers of webhosting-operator replicas with different concurrent workers are deployed.
Each instance is guaranteed 2 CPUs and 1 GiB memory.

In addition to configuring the container resource limits, the Go runtime's `GOMAXPROCS` setting in the control plane components and observed components is configured.
The `GOMAXPROCS` setting configures how many operating system threads the Go runtime spawns for executing user-level goroutines [@godocs].
By default, the setting equals the number of logical CPU cores of the machine, which is the total number of CPU cores of the hosting Node in Kubernetes Pods.
Accordingly, the Go runtime spawns more operating system threads than the CPU cores allocated via cgroup limits [@tsoukalos2021mastering].
Hence, when too many goroutines are busy, the application tries to consume more CPU cycles than the kernel scheduler allows, which results in CPU throttling.
As the Go scheduler is unaware of the kernel scheduler and vice-versa, the Go scheduler might evict running goroutines after being throttled by the kernel, leading to starvation of individual goroutines.
This results in high tail latencies for operations handled by goroutines.
Also, it increases the ratio of CPU cycles consumed by the scheduler to CPU cycles available for goroutines, which decreases the application's throughput.
[@holland2023tuning; @automaxprocs]

To prevent these effects from falsifying performance measurements of this evaluation, `GOMAXPROCS` is configured to match the CPU quota allocated for each container of the control plane and observed components.
`GOMAXPROCS` is configured via environment variables for the control plane components.
In the sharder, webhosting-operator, and experiment tool, the automaxprocs library is used to automatically configure the setting based on the container's CPU quota (`max(1, floor(cpuquota))`) [@automaxprocs].

When Kubernetes clients using client-go connect to the API server, they perform a TLS handshake with one of the API server instances.
Afterward, the client sends all requests over the established TLS connection via multiple HTTP2 streams.
With this, all API requests of a client are handled by a single API server instance[^http2issue].
In high-load situations, clients that perform a high rate of API requests, like kube-controller-manager or the experiment tool, can quickly overload the API server instance to which they are connected.
To prevent this problem from limiting load tests of this evaluation, HTTP2 is disabled in all relevant components.
With this, clients transmit HTTP requests over a pool of multiple layer 4 connections (TLS) instead of a single layer 4 connection with multiple HTTP2 streams.
This does not ensure an equal load distribution across API server instances but prevents overloading individual instances during conducted experiments.

[^http2issue]: <https://github.com/gardener/gardener/issues/8810>

To ensure a clean evaluation environment, the experiment tool restarts all observed components and waits for them to be healthy before starting the load tests.
For the measurements to be meaningful, all cluster components and all controllers are monitored during the experiments to ensure that the system is not limited due to CPU throttling, etcd disk performance, server-side or controller-side concurrency limits, or client-side rate limits.

## Measurements

Several measurements are taken during load test experiments to determine the controller's performance.
For this, the monitoring setup's Prometheus instance [@prometheusdocs] is used to collect and store metrics from the controller instances themselves, but also from kubelet's cadvisor endpoint [@k8sdocs; @cadvisor] and other exporters like kube-state-metrics [@kubestatemetrics].
After performing the load tests, the relevant metrics are retrieved from the Prometheus HTTP API using the measure tool [@studyproject] for later analysis and visualization.
The tool fetches raw time series data and stores the result matrices in CSV-formatted files.
Additionally, the tool is extended to support instant queries for calculating percentiles over a configured time range.
This is used to verify that configured SLOs are satisfied during a load test experiment.

For the measurements to be meaningful, the Kubernetes cluster SLOs themselves, as described in [@sec:kubernetes-scalability], must be satisfied.
I.e., it must be ensured that the cluster itself, where the controllers are running, is performing well.
While the latency of API requests (SLI 1 and 2) is relevant for the experiment setup, pod startup latency (SLI 3) is irrelevant as the load tests do not trigger pod startups.

```yaml
queries:
- name: latency-mutating # SLO 1
  type: instant
  slo: 1
  query: |
    histogram_quantile(0.99, sum by (resource, verb, le) (rate(

        verb!~"GET|LIST|WATCH",
        subresource!~"log|exec|portforward|attach|proxy"
      }[$__range]
    ))) > 0

        verb=~"GET|LIST", scope="resource",
        subresource!~"log|exec|portforward|attach|proxy"
      }[$__range]
    ))) > 0

        verb=~"GET|LIST", scope=~"namespace|cluster",
        subresource!~"log|exec|portforward|attach|proxy"
      }[$__range]
    ))) > 0
```

: Queries for verifying control plane SLOs {#lst:k8s-slo-queries}

In the context of this evaluation, both API request latency SLIs are defined even more strictly.
The official SLIs exclude custom resources, but they are explicitly included in the measurements of this evaluation.
This is done because the webhosting-operator's main resources are extended resources.
Furthermore, the latency measurements for mutating API calls include the webhook call latency, as the sharder webhook is an integral element of the evaluated sharding design.
Considering the setup's performance, the request latency increase caused by the sharder webhook should be reasonably low.
Without considering these aspects, the measurements would not be meaningful for the concrete experiment setup.
Including extended resources and webhook call latency in the SLIs will yield worse performance measurements.
Hence, the cluster performs well if the stricter measurements can still satisfy the official SLOs.

Based on the control plane's metrics, the experiments verify that both SLOs are satisfied using the queries shown in [@lst:k8s-slo-queries].
The queries are similar to those used in Kubernetes performance tests[^perftests-queries] for the same purpose [@perftests].
The `$__range` placeholder is substituted by the corresponding experiment's duration.
I.e., SLIs are not measured per cluster-day but only for the load test duration.

[^perftests-queries]: <https://github.com/kubernetes/perf-tests/blob/release-1.29/clusterloader2/pkg/measurement/common/slos/api_responsiveness_prometheus.go>

Next, experiments record the load on the evaluated controller setup to determine the load capacity of a setup using a given resource configuration and to allow for the comparison of results of different scenarios.
For this, both load dimensions of controllers defined in [@sec:controller-scalability] are measured for the tested controller.
Applied to the webhosting-opperator, the number of objects watched and reconciled by the controller (dimension 1) is the number of `Website` objects in the cluster.
This can be measured using the `kube_website_info` metric exposed for every `Website` object by the operator.
On the other hand, the churn rate of API objects (dimension 2) for the webhosting-operator is the rate at which clients create, update, and delete `Website` objects.
In experiments, `Website` reconciliations are triggered by mutating the `spec.theme` field.
The experiment tool builds upon controller-runtime, and different controllers perform individual actions of scenarios in the form of reconciliations.
Hence, this load dimension can be measured using the reconciliation-related metrics exposed by controller-runtime.
[@Lst:load-queries] shows the precise queries for measuring the described load dimensions during experiments.

```yaml
queries:
- name: website-count # dimension 1
  query: |
    sum(kube_website_info)
- name: website-churn # dimension 2
  query: |
    sum(rate(
      controller_runtime_reconcile_total{
        job="experiment", result!="error",
        controller=~"website-(generator|deleter|mutator)"
      }[1m]
    )) by (controller)
```

: Queries for measuring controller load {#lst:load-queries}

To ensure the controller setup is performing well under the generated load, the SLIs for controllers defined in [@sec:controller-scalability] are also measured.
The time that object keys are enqueued for reconciliation (SLI 1) is directly derived from the queue-related metrics exposed by controller-runtime.
For SLI 2, the experiment tool measures the time until changes to the desired state of `Websites` are reconciled and ready.

The API server automatically increases an object's generation for its creation and for every specification change.
The experiment tool stores the time it triggered the change for all object generations.
It then waits for a watch event that updates the `status.observedGeneration` field accordingly and for the `status.phase` field to be `Ready`.
The tool stores the time when the respective watch event was received.
Then, it asynchronously records the time it took the controller to observe the new generation and for the `Website` to become ready in a histogram metric (`experiment_website_reconciliation_duration_seconds`).
To verify that latency in receiving the watch events does not falsify the tool's measurements, the `Website` controller records the timestamp when a new generation of a `Website` got ready in the `status.lastTransitionTime` field.
The tool records the duration between the `lastTransitionTime` and the time the event handler received and processed the watch event in another histogram metric.
The experiment's measurements are only meaningful if the watch event latency is reasonably low.

In this scenario, the tool is a client of the `Website` API, i.e., an observer of the system's user experience.
As the reconciliation latency observed by the client includes the time until the corresponding watch event is received, it is essential to include this time in the measurements to reflect the actual user experience.
For secondary reconciliation triggers, e.g., changing the referenced `Theme`, it is difficult to measure how long it takes the controller to observe the external change and reconcile `Websites` accordingly.
Thus, `Theme` mutations are not performed during load test experiments for more accurate measurements.

```yaml
queries:
- name: latency-queue # SLO 1
  type: instant
  slo: 1
  query: |
    histogram_quantile(0.99, sum by (le) (rate(
        workqueue_queue_duration_seconds_bucket{
          job="webhosting-operator", name="website"
        }[$__range]
    )))
- name: latency-reconciliation # SLO 2
  type: instant
  slo: 5
  query: |
    histogram_quantile(0.99, sum by (le) (rate(
        experiment_website_reconciliation_duration_seconds_bucket{
          job="experiment"
        }[$__range]
    )))
```

: Queries for verifying controller SLOs {#lst:controller-slo-queries}

[@Lst:controller-slo-queries] shows the queries verifying the described controller SLOs.
Similar to verifying the control plane's SLOs, the measurements are taken over the load test duration instead of per cluster-day.
Note that the measurement for SLI 2 is stricter than the definition in [@sec:controller-scalability].
Initially, the reconciliation latency SLI excluded the reconciliation time of controlled objects, as they are outside the scope of the measured controller's responsibility.
However, in the load tests, the reconciliation time of controlled objects â€“ namely, `Deployments` â€“ is short because they do not run any replicas.
The `Deployment` controller must only observe the object and set the `Available` condition to `True`.
Hence, the measurement used for verifying SLO 2 includes the reconciliation time `Deployments` of `Websites` for simplicity.
Furthermore, the user's performance expectations are the same regardless of whether the controller uses sharding.
Therefore, the measurement includes the sharding assignment latency related to the sharder's webhook or the sharder's controller, respectively.

```yaml
queries:
- name: cpu # observed by cadvisor
  query: |
    sum by (namespace, pod) (rate(
      container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{
        pod=~"sharder-.+|webhosting-operator-.+",
        container=~"sharder|manager"
      }[1m]
    ))
- name: memory # observed by go runtime
  query: |
    sum by (namespace, pod) (
      go_memory_classes_total_bytes{pod=~"sharder-.+|webhosting-operator-.+"}
      - go_memory_classes_heap_released_bytes{
        pod=~"sharder-.+|webhosting-operator-.+"
      }
      - go_memory_classes_heap_unused_bytes{
        pod=~"sharder-.+|webhosting-operator-.+"
      }
      - go_memory_classes_heap_free_bytes{
        pod=~"sharder-.+|webhosting-operator-.+"
      }
    )
- name: network_receive # observed by cadvisor
  query: |
    sum by (namespace, pod) (rate(
      container_network_receive_bytes_total{
        pod=~"sharder-.+|webhosting-operator-.+"
      }[1m]
    ))
- name: network_transmit # observed by cadvisor
  query: |
    sum by (namespace, pod) (rate(
      container_network_transmit_bytes_total{
        pod=~"sharder-.+|webhosting-operator-.+"
      }[1m]
    ))
```

: Queries for measuring controller resource usage {#lst:resource-usage-queries}

In addition to measuring the load and performance of the controllers, experiments record the resource consumption of the sharding components and the webhosting-operator as shown in [@lst:resource-usage-queries].
Like the experiments in the study project [@studyproject], the CPU and network usage is measured based on the kubelet's cadvisor metrics [@k8sdocs; @prometheusdocs].
Note that the measured network transfer includes regular scraping operations.
Prometheus is configured to scrape metrics from sharder and webhosting-operator every 10 seconds.
Parca is configured to scrape profiling data from sharder and webhosting-operator every 2 seconds.

On the other hand, the controllers' memory usage is determined based on metrics exposed by the Go runtime.
This gives a better estimation of the actual memory requirements of the controller than the kernel's resident size set (RSS) record of the process due to how Go facilitates memory management.
The Go runtime does not immediately release heap memory freed by garbage collection back to the operating system.
Hence, the process can hold more memory of the system than the program needs, also due to the runtime's batch-based memory allocation.
The query in this evaluation subtracts all released, unused, and free memory from the total amount of memory allocated by the process.

A unique ID is attached to every run and added as the `run_id` label to the corresponding metrics to distinguish between individual experiment runs.
The experiment tool is deployed as a Kubernetes `Job`, and the UID of the executing `Pod` is used as the run's ID.
Before starting the actual load test, the experiment tool injects the run ID as a label into the sharder and webhosting-operator `Deployment`.
Additionally, Prometheus is configured to copy the `run_id` label from the `Pods` to the scraped metrics.
With this, all metrics from individual runs can be queried separately and selected by run ID.

A dashboard that visualizes the most important measurements of experiments is added to the monitoring setup's Grafana instance.
It shows the generated load in both dimensions and the resulting SLIs ([@fig:dashboard-experiments]).
The dashboard calculates the visualized SLIs as rolling percentiles, e.g. over 1 minute.
Additionally, it displays the CPU, memory, and network usage of the sharder and webhosting-operator pods.

![Experiments Grafana dashboard](../assets/dashboard-experiments.png){#fig:dashboard-experiments}

## Experiments

Multiple experiments are performed based on the described experiment setup.
The different scenarios, their goals, and their results are described in the following sections.
All scenarios are implemented and executed using the experiment tool.

### Comparison {#sec:eval-comparison}

The first experiment scenario generates a basic load to compare the different controller setups.
It evaluates how the setups perform under load, ensures that the defined SLOs are satisfied, and measures the components' resource consumption.
This scenario does not determine the load capacity of different setups and resource configurations.
Instead, it determines how many resources must be added to the system to sustain the generated load.
Most importantly, it observes how load and resource consumption are distributed across multiple instances.

In the `basic` scenario, the experiment tool creates, deletes, and updates `Website` objects for 15 minutes.
For this, it runs three controllers:

- The `website-generator` creates 12 random `Websites` per second.
- The `website-deleter` deletes 2 random `Websites` per second.
- The `website-mutator` updates each `Website` spec every minute.

With this, the generated load slowly increases over 15 minutes.
The number of objects (dimension 1) grows to roughly 9,000, while the churn rate grows to roughly 160 changes per second ([@fig:basic-load]).

![Generated load in basic scenario](../results/basic/load.pdf){#fig:basic-load}

The experiment scenario is executed for all three controller setups: singleton, internal sharder setup, and external sharder setup.
For all three setups, measurements are performed as described above, and the defined SLOs are verified.
Additional checks are performed to ensure the system is not limited anywhere and generally performs well, e.g., that all created `Website` objects eventually get ready.
If all of these prerequisites are fulfilled, the resulting resource usage of the webhosting-operator and sharder are recorded to deduce how many resources are needed for sustaining the generated load ([@fig:basic-cpu; @fig:basic-memory; @fig:basic-network]).

By default, the webhosting-operator runs 15 concurrent workers for the `website` controller.
If the webhosting-operator is deployed as a singleton controller, it runs 50 workers for the `website` controller to allow for the comparison of experiment runs of sharded and non-sharded setups with the same load.
If the internal sharder is enabled, the leader instance runs 5 workers for the `shardlease` controller and 10 workers for the `sharder` controllers, respectively.

![CPU usage by pod in basic scenario](../results/basic/cpu.pdf){#fig:basic-cpu}

![Memory usage by pod in basic scenario](../results/basic/memory.pdf){#fig:basic-memory}

![Network usage by pod in basic scenario](../results/basic/network.pdf){#fig:basic-network}

The results show that the external sharder setup distributes the controller's resource usage well across shards.
Each shard roughly consumes a third of the resources consumed by the singleton controller.
The results also show that performing sharding for controllers comes with an unavoidable resource overhead.
However, the external sharder's overhead is constant and does not increase with the controller's load in contrast to the internal sharder's overhead.
With this, the external sharder setup fulfills req. \ref{req:constant}, while the internal sharder setup does not.

### Horizontal Scalability {#sec:eval-scale-out}

The second experiment evaluates the horizontal scalability of the external sharder design and implementation.
As described in [@sec:kubernetes-scalability], measuring the scalability of a system involves determining the maximum load capacity of different resource configurations.
The system is scalable if the load capacity can be increased by adding more resources.
The system is said to be horizontally scalable if resources are added as additional instances without adding resources to individual instances.

In the `scale-out` scenario, the experiment tool generates a load with a high churn rate over 15 minutes.
The number of objects (dimension 1) grows up to roughly 9,000, and the churn rate grows up to roughly 300 changes per second ([@fig:scale-out-load]):

- The `website-generator` creates 10 random `Websites` per second.
- The `website-mutator` updates each `Website` spec twice per minute.

![Generated load in scale out scenario](../results/scale-out/load.pdf){#fig:scale-out-load}

The scenario is executed for the external sharder setup with 1 to 5 webhosting-operator instances, each running 5 concurrent workers for the `Website` controller.
To determine the maximum load capacity for which the SLOs are still satisfied, the SLIs are calculated every 15 seconds instead of once for the entire time window.
For this, the SLO queries shown in [@lst:controller-slo-queries] are changed to range queries that consider all observations from the start of the experiment (cumulative percentiles) as shown in [@lst:controller-sli-queries-cumulative].

```yaml
queries:
- name: latency-queue # SLI 1
  query: |
    histogram_quantile(0.99, sum by (le) (
      workqueue_queue_duration_seconds_bucket{
        job="webhosting-operator", name="website"
      }
    ))
- name: latency-reconciliation # SLI 2
  query: |
    histogram_quantile(0.99, sum by (le) (
      experiment_website_reconciliation_duration_seconds_bucket{
        job="experiment"
      }
    ))
```

: Queries for calculating cumulative controller SLIs {#lst:controller-sli-queries-cumulative}

Usually, the `histogram_quantile` query function is combined with a `rate` function applied to the number of observations per histogram bucket with upper bounds as specified in the `le` label.
This calculates a per-second increase of observations per bucket averaged across the range duration.
This evaluation does not use a range vector or `rate` function, only the total number of observations.
This results in a time series that shows the 99th percentile of latency observations from the start of the experiment up until the value's time.
Note that the `histogram_quantile` calculation estimates the actual quantile based on histogram buckets and linear interpolation.
This causes the calculated SLIs to grow quickly when more observations start falling into the next higher histogram bucket.
For example, when buckets with upper bounds of 1 and 10 are used, the estimated 99th percentile quickly grows from less than 1 to less than 10, although the actual percentile might grow slower [@prometheusdocs].
However, the buckets' upper bounds are aligned with the SLOs for this evaluation.
This means that for every SLI, there is a bucket with the upper bound set to the corresponding SLO.
As interpolation is only applied between the bucket boundaries, the estimated SLI will grow above the SLO when the actual SLI grows above the SLO and vice-versa.

![Cumulative controller SLOs per instance count](../results/scale-out/slis.pdf){#fig:scale-out-slis}

After the experiment, the control plane SLOs are verified, and the measurements are retrieved from Prometheus.
For each instance count, the last timestamp where the measured SLIs still satisfied the defined SLOs is determined ([@fig:scale-out-slis]).
This timestamp is then used to look up values for both load dimensions.
The resulting value represents the maximum load capacity of each controller setup ([@fig:scale-out-capacity]).
Note that the load capacity values cannot be interpreted as absolute values but only relative to other values of the same load test.

![Load capacity increase with added instances](../results/scale-out/capacity.pdf){#fig:scale-out-capacity}

The results show that adding more controller instances brings more performance and increases the maximum load capacity of the system.
The load capacity grows almost linearly with the number of added instances, so the setup fulfills req. \ref{req:scale-out}.
With this, applying the external sharding design makes Kubernetes controllers horizontally scalable.

### Rolling Updates

TODO (but optional)

- rolling updates of controller
- evaluate coordination on object movements
- show that SLOs are still met

### Chaos Testing

TODO (but optional)

- randomly kill instances
- similar to [knative chaosduck](https://github.com/knative/pkg/blob/main/leaderelection/chaosduck/main.go#L17)
- show that SLOs are still met

### Autoscaling

TODO (but optional)

- similar to scale out scenario
- horizontal autoscaling of controller according to load
  - HPA on queue duration (SLI 1)
- evaluate coordination on object movements

## Discussion

The performed evaluation shows that the presented design and implementation make Kubernetes controllers horizontally scalable.
The experiments demonstrate that the sharding mechanism distributes object responsibility and the reconciliation work evenly across multiple controller instances.
Each of the $n$ shards is responsible for roughly $1/n$ objects and roughly requires $1/n$ resources of the traditional singleton controller setup.

Although the sharding mechanism incurs an overhead in resource consumption, the overhead is minimal and negligible at scale.
Most importantly, the sharder's resource footprint is constant even when the controller's load increases, i.e., when it has to handle more objects or a higher object churn rate.
In total, the external sharder setup only requires a little more resources than the singleton controller setup to sustain the same load.
With this, the evaluation has shown that the presented design and implementation fulfills req. \ref{req:constant}.

Furthermore, the evaluation shows that the external sharder design provides incremental scale-out properties and fulfills req. \ref{req:scale-out}.
The load capacity of the controller system can be incrementally increased by adding more instances.
With the presented design, the load capacity increases almost linearly with the number of added controller instances.
This proves that the architecture is horizontally scalable as defined in [@bondi2000characteristics; @duboc2007framework] ([@sec:kubernetes-scalability]).
